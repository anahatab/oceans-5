        <p> The <a href="http://www.oceanhealthindex.org/news/Biodiversity_In_The_Deep_Sea"
            target="_blank"> Ocean Health Index </a> has a great article about some really cool
            species that are found in the deep sea, the part of the ocean that
            is distinctly colder than more shallow layers, and is significantly
            far from what is known as the continental shelf. </p>

      <h2> Decline in Biodiversity </h2>
        <p> According to the <a href="https://ocean-climate.org/?page_id=2133&lang=en"
            target="_blank"> Ocean & Climate platform </a>, biodiversity in the oceans is
            declining at an alarming rate. The ocean is a vast "micro-ecosystem", and
            the health of this biome is highly dependent on the biodiversity that exists
            within it. </p>
        <p> Why is the health of the ocean important? Other than keeping the fishies
            happy, the ocean is very important in regulating the Earth's climate by
            absorbing a great deal of solar UV radiation that comes into ours
            atmosphere. Without this function, that radiation remains in the air,
            heating it up and negatively impacting many of the species that live on
            land. </p>
        <p> Therefore, keeping the ocean's biodiversity in tact directly benefits
            us humans who may be living far from any ocean. Understanding the role
            that underwater species play in the ecosystem can help push new policies
            and practices that lead to more eco-friendly living. </p>

            more about this topic by clicking <a href="https://ocean-climate.org/?page_id=2133&lang=en"
