    <h2> Climate Change </h2>
      <p> According to the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/oceans"
          target="_blank"> EPA </a>, the oceans, which cover about 70% of the Earth,
          have a two-way relationship with global climate. This is reflective of the
          interconnectedness of the geosphere and ecosystem at every scale. </p>
      <p> There is data to prove that the oceans are holding more heat than they did
          60 years ago. This leads to changes in biodiversity in the ocean ecosystem
          because some species may not be able to survive the increase in temperature.
          Increased temperature also means changes to the chemical composition of
          ocean water as well as melting of ice caps and glaciers, causing a rise in
          sea level and coastal flooding. </p>

    <h2> A Look Into Current Research </h2>
      <h3> What does this all mean? </h3>
      <p> What does this all look like? Many of us live pretty far from the oceans
          and it's hard to conceptualize the actual effects of non-ecofriendly
          living on the Earth and ultimately our lives and the future. </p>
      <p> There are many scientists analyzing data, constructing models, and
          publishing results that answer these questions. Why should we care
          about the oceans? What can we do differently? </p>
    <p> Bijma et. al. published a paper in the Marine Pollution Bulletin in 2013
      that goes into great detail about the future of the geosphere given the
      current state of climate change and how that is affecting the oceans. </p>
      <p> Some key points made by the authors include: </p>
        <ul>
          <li> ocean acidification </li>
          <li> freshening </li>
          <li> stratification </li>
          <li> deoxygenation, and </li>
          <li> decline of sensitive species. </li>
        </ul>
        <p> The authors conclude that these impacts will result in a variety of
            negative biological consequences to our oceans. These include change
            in oxygen output (what we breathe!), increased species invasions and
            turnover (which could potentially lead to disease), and increased
            extintions and coral reef mortality. </p>
